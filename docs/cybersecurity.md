# Cybersecurity baseline

Project type: **WordPress plugin**. Default branch: `main`.

Added scans: Semgrep CE, TruffleHog, zizmor, Trivy (weekly/manual on private repos), WordPress PHPCS (weekly/manual on private repos). Existing checks are retained.
One Linux job shares setup across tools; timeout is 15 minutes and superseded runs
are cancelled. Private repos run fast source/secret/workflow checks on PRs, with
Trivy and WordPress PHPCS on weekly/manual runs. There is no duplicate private
push run. Public repositories also scan default-branch pushes and run heavy checks
on PRs. These conditions use the verified visibility at rollout; review them if
visibility changes. A weekly scan can detect dependency issues after a PR merges:
manually run the full baseline on a release candidate before shipping.

Budget planning: target 500 minutes/month for new private security checks, leaving
headroom for existing CI within the account's 2,000-minute Free allowance. This is
an estimate, not an enforced cap: measure actual durations and count all existing
workflows, dependabot PRs and retries. Example: 20 PR runs/week at 4 minutes plus
8 weekly scans at 5 minutes is about 516 minutes/month (4.3 weeks).
New Dependabot schedules are monthly with at most two open PRs per ecosystem.
Security updates remain urgent; do not defer an exploited vulnerability to that schedule.

All new scan findings fail the job. Installation, parsing or database errors are
incomplete coverage, never a clean result. Legacy findings need review; do not add
broad exclusions merely to make CI green. Review narrow exceptions with an owner,
reason and expiry. Existing advisory workflows remain explicitly advisory.

Source paths are in `.github/security/profile.json`. Generated/minified code and
vendor/node_modules are excluded from custom-code SAST; Trivy scans supported
lockfiles separately. Semgrep's engine is pinned; upstream registry packs may
evolve independently. A green scan does not establish that the application is safe.

Existing Gitleaks is preserved where present. New TruffleHog scans use PR commit
ranges or all fetched history otherwise, without credential verification. Output
contains only detector/file/line, never secret values. Deleted/unfetched refs are
not covered. Rotate a real leak before removing it from history.

Psalm taint analysis is a subsequent tuned phase: framework hooks/stubs, sources,
sinks and test cases must be modeled first. Existing PHPStan/Larastan is retained.
CodeQL does not scan PHP. ZAP/WPScan require an isolated staging target and WPScan
vulnerability API access; no production-targeted scan or deployment is added.

CLI failures work on private GitHub Free without paid SARIF features. Protected
branches on private repositories are unavailable on that plan. This change does
not alter release triggers; maintainers must verify the exact release commit.
Never ship `.github/security` or its tooling in application packages.

Public conversion is a separate decision. Review full history, release assets,
credentials, personal data, licensing and fork restrictions before changing
visibility. No visibility changes are part of this rollout.


## Public repository update — 2026-09-29

Visibility verified public. Heavy Trivy and WordPress security checks now run on every PR, default-branch push, weekly schedule and manual run. CodeQL JavaScript analysis is enabled. Earlier private-only cadence descriptions are superseded by this section. Narrow PHPCS annotations document reviewed validation/output boundaries; maintainer review due 2026-12-29 or when the annotated code changes.

## Security gate

`.github/workflows/security-gate.yml` is the only workflow that triggers the
security scans: on pull requests and pushes to the default branch, weekly, and
manually. The scan workflows (the baseline and, where present, CodeQL and the
older security workflow) are reusable and run only through it. The gate also adds
dependency audits for shipped lockfiles and, on pull requests where the repository has the dependency graph enabled, dependency review.
Its final job, **All security checks passed**, fails unless every check succeeded;
a cancelled or unexpectedly skipped check counts as a failure.

Release workflows call the same gate on the release commit, so a package is built
only when every check passes on exactly that commit. Branch protection on public
repositories requires **All security checks passed** (plus the code-scanning
**CodeQL** check where CodeQL runs). Private repositories on GitHub Free cannot
enforce required checks, so review the gate result before merging there.

## WordPress checks and link checking (2026-10-06)

`wordpress-checks.yml` runs through the security gate, so **All security checks passed** depends on it.
- **Plugin Check**: WordPress's official [Plugin Check](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check-action), in a throwaway WordPress (wp-env).
  - It runs the general, security, performance and accessibility categories. Errors fail the job; warnings show as annotations.
  - The `plugin_repo` category is left out. It holds WordPress.org listing rules (for example "no own updater"), and this plugin is self-hosted.
  - The `slug` is the text domain, so translation calls are checked against it.
- **Playground smoke test**: `.github/playground/smoke.py` boots [WordPress Playground](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/) on each PHP version in the matrix and activates the plugin. It adds a fixture page, logs in, and loads the front end and every wp-admin menu page. It fails on:
  - activation errors;
  - pages that don't answer 200;
  - a PHP error or the critical-error screen on a page;
  - any PHP error, warning, notice or deprecation in `debug.log` from this repository's code.

  The site, its database and its admin account exist only inside the job. To run it locally (needs Node 24 with npx, and Python 3): `python3 .github/playground/smoke.py --php 8.4`. Settings are in `.github/playground/config.json`.
- **Links**: `links.yml` checks the links in Markdown and `readme.txt` files with [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee). It runs on pull requests that change them, monthly and on demand. It is not part of the security gate, because a third-party site being down should not block a merge. Exclusions are in `.lychee.toml`; adventistai.lt is excluded because its Cloudflare bot protection answers GitHub runners with 403.
